# acs-demos
Demo's for Azure Container Service.

Right now the repository only containers "incubating" demos, that is
ones that mat need a little more work before they can be easily
reproduced.

## Incubator

The incubator folder is the place for incoming demos. These are
probably less complete than demos in the root. It might require some
digging around to understand how to build and use them. Once a number
of people have been able to reproduce an incubating demo then we will
move it into the root.

If you work on an incubating demo the most important thing you can do
is provide documentation and scripting that makes it as easy as
possible to reproduce. If you have problems getting an incubating demo
to work then raise an issue and we will try to help.

### Big Little Challenge

This is a card game designed to demonstrate multicontainer applications running in 
different orchestrators with minimal changes.

### PiSwarm

PiSwarm is a hardware project to build a cluster of Raspberry Pis running Docker 
Swarm. Such a cluster can be used to demonstrate the ability to run these demo's 
in multiple environments. Showing the application running on Azure Container Service 
and a cluster of Raspberry Pis can sometimes be a powerful demonstration.
