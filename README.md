# The Big Little Challenge

The goal of this project is to introduce young and old programmers to
open osurce collaboration while building a game. It's about fun and
learning. The code outputs are secondary. It's a playground with
enough structure around it to provide common ground for participants.

# Status

This is little more than an idea right now. We will be pitching the
idea, and starting to work on it at SEAGL, a community run conference
in Seattle, Nov 12 2016. We look forward to your involvement.


# Building a Game

At the simplest level we are building a game. It's a simple game. It's
not intended to be a AAA best seller, or even a bargain bin item. Of
course, if we happen to produce something valuable it's open source,
so go do what you can with it.
