# The Big Little Challenge

The goal of this project is to introduce young and old programmers to
open osurce collaboration while building a game. It's about fun and
learning. The code outputs are secondary. It's a playground with
enough structure around it to provide common ground for participants.

# Status

This is little more than an idea right now. We will be pitching the
idea, and starting to work on it at SEAGL, a community run conference
in Seattle, Nov 12 2016. We look forward to your involvement.


# Building a Game

At the simplest level we are building card games. They are simple
games. They aren't intended to be a AAA best seller, or even a bargain
bin item. We are creating them for fun, so lets enjoy. 

See our ['Generalized Description of Card Games'](wiki/Card-Game-Treatise).

Of course, if we happen to produce something valuable it's open
source, so go do what you can with it.

## Games

Here's some game ideas, listed in alphabetic order:

1. [Narhumo](wiki/Narhumo-Rules)
2. [Olympics](docs/olympics/intro.md)
3. [Sharks and ands](wiki/Hen-Game::Sharks-and-Sands)
	

## PiKube: A Kubernetes Cluster

Card games have to be run somewhere, why not on a [Raspberry Pi
Kubernetes Cluster](docs/pikube/index.md)?
