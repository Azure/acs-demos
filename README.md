# acs-demos
Demo's for Azure Container Service.

## Big Little Challenge

This is a card game designed to demonstrate multicontainer applications running in 
different orchestrators with minimal changes.

## PiSwarm

PiSwarm is a hardware project to build a cluster of Raspberry Pis running Docker 
Swarm. Such a cluster can be used to demonstrate the ability to run these demo's 
in multiple environments. Showing the application running on Azure Container Service 
and a cluster of Raspberry Pis can sometimes be a powerful demonstration.
