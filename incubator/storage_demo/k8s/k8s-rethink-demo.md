# RethinkDB Storage Demo on Kubernetes

This demo shows the use of persistent volumes in Kubernetes for storing RethinkRB state.  In this demo, the following will be covered:

- Deployment of a Kubernetes cluster on Azure
- The structure of the YAML file for deploying RethinkDB
- The deployment of the RethinkDB service
- Demonstrate the node RethinkDB is running on
- Interact with RethinkDB:
    - Create a table
    - Insert some data
    - Show the table
- Destroy the RethinkDB pod
- Show redeployment of RethinkDB service
- Show data previously inserted is still present

## Deploying a Kubernetes cluster

To deploy the Kubernetes cluster, it is assumed that you have the [Azure CLI](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli) installed and logged in.

To deploy the cluster, we need to:

- Create a resource group
- Deploy the cluster

Create the resource group named `jmsbck8rg` in `westus` as follows:

```bash
jims@azhat:~$ az group create --name "jmsbck8rg" --location="westus"
{
  "id": "/subscriptions/04f7ec88-8e28-41ed-8537-5e17766001f5/resourceGroups/jmsbck8rg",
  "location": "westus",
  "managedBy": null,
  "name": "jmsbck8rg",
  "properties": {
    "provisioningState": "Succeeded"
  },
  "tags": null
}
```

For the cluster, we will use the following settings:

- `admin-username`: `sadmin`
- `agent-count`:    `3`
- `agent-vm-size`:  `Standard_D3_v2`
- `master-count`:   `1`
- `dns-prefix`:     `jsk8`
- `name`:           `acsbck8s`

```bash
jims@azhat:~$ az acs create --name="acsbck8s" --resource-group="jmsbck8rg" --admin-username=sadmin --agent-count=3 --agent-vm-size="Standard_D3_v2" --dns-prefix="jsk8" --location="westus" --master-count=1 --orchestrator-type=kubernetes --ssh-key-value @/home/jims/.ssh/id_jmsk8s_rsa.pub

{
  "id": "/subscriptions/04f7ec88-8e28-41ed-8537-5e17766001f5/resourceGroups/jmsbck8rg/providers/Microsoft.Resources/deployments/azurecli1486924695.6415310",
  "name": "azurecli1486924695.6415310",
  "properties": {
    "correlationId": "6a23ec86-3b7d-45e0-84d1-6db8c5730237",
    "debugSetting": null,
    "dependencies": [],
    "mode": "Incremental",
    "outputs": null,
    "parameters": {
      "clientSecret": {
        "type": "SecureString"
      }
    },
    "parametersLink": null,
    "providers": [
      {
        "id": null,
        "namespace": "Microsoft.ContainerService",
        "registrationState": null,
        "resourceTypes": [
          {
            "aliases": null,
            "apiVersions": null,
            "locations": [
              "westus"
            ],
            "properties": null,
            "resourceType": "containerServices"
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "provisioningState": "Succeeded",
    "template": null,
    "templateLink": null,
    "timestamp": "2017-02-12T18:43:24.096870+00:00"
  },
  "resourceGroup": "jmsbck8rg"
}
```

In order to interact with the Kubernetes cluster, we need to retrieve the `kube.config` file:

```bash
jims@azhat:~$ az acs kubernetes get-credentials --name=acsbck8s --resource-group=jmsbck8rg --ssh-key-file=/home/jims/.ssh/id_jmsk8s_rsa
```

It is also assumed that you have `kubectl` installed at this point.

To verify the cluster is running and is accessible:

```bash
jims@azhat:~$ kubectl get all
NAME             CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE
svc/kubernetes   10.0.0.1     <none>        443/TCP   4m
```

## Configuring and deploying RethinkDB

[RethinkDB](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb) is an open-source NoSQL JSON document database.  For this next part, we will setup the YAML configuration file such that RethinkDB is deployed with an associated persistent volume.  This is done by generating the YAML configuration file.

To define a persistent volume on Kubernetes, there are three parts one needs to configure:

- Storage Class
- Persistent Volume Claim
- Associate the Volume Claim with the service and assign a mountpoint

The Storage Class would resemble as follows:

```bash
kind: StorageClass
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1beta1
metadata:
  name: slow
  namespace: rethinkdb
provisioner: kubernetes.io/azure-disk
parameters:
  skuName: Standard_LRS
```

In this case, a storage class named `slow` is specified to use the `azure-disk` provisioner.

A Persistent Volume Claim defines the type (Storage Class), size, and name of a vollume to generate.  The configuration resembles:

```bash
apiVersion: "v1"
kind: "PersistentVolumeClaim"
metadata:
  name: "rethinkdb-pv"
  namespace: "rethinkdb"
  annotations:
    volume.beta.kubernetes.io/storage-class: "slow"
spec:
  accessModes:
    - "ReadWriteOnce"
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: "10Gi"
```

Finally, once a volume claim has been defined, it has to be associated with the deployment template:

```bash
      containers:
      - name: master
        image: rethinkdb:2.3.5
        command: [ "rethinkdb" ]
        args: [ "--bind", "all", "-d", "/data/rethinkdb_home/db" ]
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
        - containerPort: 28015
        volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /data/rethinkdb_home
          name: rethinkdb-home
        resources:
          limits:
            cpu: 1000m
            memory: 8000Mi
          requests:
            cpu: 1000m
            memory: 8000Mi
      volumes:
      - name: rethinkdb-home
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: rethinkdb-pv
```

The Persistent Volume Claim is associated with a volume and that volume is then given a mountpoint in the container.

Note, for this demo, we are deploying RethinkDB version 2.3.5 which has an existing Docker image.  The complete YAML file for deploying RethinkDB is as follows:

        targetPort: 28015
        name: rethinkdb-admin-port        
# [END rethinkdb_service]
```

The deployment exposes two external ports `8080` (the RethinkDB UI) and `28015` which is the port RethinkDB clients connect to.  With this deployment, the ports are publicly accessible and probably should be more controlled / contained in a production environment.

Using `kubectl`, the YAML file `rethinkdb_pv.yaml` can be deployed as follows:

```bash
jims@azhat:~/src/github/acsbc_storage/k8s$ kubectl create -f ./rethink/rethinkdb_pv.yaml 
namespace "rethinkdb" created
storageclass "slow" created
persistentvolumeclaim "rethinkdb-pv" created
deployment "rethinkdb" created
service "rethinkdb" created
```

Azure disk operations, especially in the current version of Kubernetes deployed to ACS, can take some time.  The provisioning and formatting of the Persistent Volume may take upwards of ten minutes.

To check the status of the RethinkDB deployment:

```bash
jims@azhat:~/src/github/acsbc_storage/k8s$ kubectl --namespace=rethinkdb get pods
NAME                        READY     STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
rethinkdb-111383062-m3b76   0/1       ContainerCreating   0          1m
```

Waiting awhile, you should eventually see:

```bash
jims@azhat:~/src/github/acsbc_storage/k8s$ kubectl --namespace=rethinkdb get pods
NAME                        READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
rethinkdb-111383062-m3b76   1/1       Running   0          19m
```

If one wanted to see more detail about the pod `rethinkdb-111383062-m3b76`, you could use the `describe` command with `kubectl` as follows:

```bash
jims@azhat:~/src/github/acsbc_storage/k8s$ kubectl --namespace=rethinkdb describe pod rethinkdb-111383062-m3b76

## Interacting with RethinkDB

In order to connect to RethinkDB, it is necessary to determine the IP address and ports RethinkDB is accessible from.  From the YAML file above, the service defined ports 8080 and 28015, to determine the IP address for the service and verify that the ports are indeed open:

```bash
jims@azhat:~/src/github/acsbc_storage/k8s$ kubectl --namespace=rethinkdb get svc
NAME        CLUSTER-IP    EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                          AGE
rethinkdb   10.0.52.247   13.64.114.4   8080:30180/TCP,28015:31336/TCP   28m
```

The above indicated that the external IP address of the service is `13.64.114.4` and that, indeed, ports 8080 and 28105 are open.  To verify, we could run `wget` as follows:

```bash
jims@azhat:~/src/github/acsbc_storage/k8s$ wget http://13.64.114.4:8080
--2017-02-13 09:24:45--  http://13.64.114.4:8080/
Connecting to 13.64.114.4:8080... connected.
HTTP request sent, awaiting response... 200 OK

Saving to: ‘index.html’

index.html                             [ <=>                                                             ]   3.21K  --.-KB/s    in 0.001s  

2017-02-13 09:24:45 (2.88 MB/s) - ‘index.html’ saved [3291]
```

So, now it is time to interact with RethinkDB.  To do this, a simple NodeJS application is developed using the RethinkDB client library.  It's usage is as follows:

```bash
jims@azhat:~/src/github/acsbc_storage/app$ node ./index.js --help
Usage:
  index.js [OPTIONS] [ARGS]

Options: 
  -h, --host [STRING]    RethinkDB hostname (Default is localhost)
  -p, --port [NUMBER]    RethinkDB port (Default is 8080)
  -a, --action [STRING]  Action to perform (create, insert, get, delete)  (Default is get)
  -t, --table STRING     Table name
  -f, --datafile STRING  RethinkDB datafile
```

In order to use the app, it is assumed that you have NodeJS installed.  Also, in order to actually use it, the required modules need to be installed as well.  To do that:

```bash
jims@azhat:~/src/github/acsbc_storage/app$ npm install .
rethink_test.js@0.0.1 /home/jims/src/github/acsbc_storage/app
├─┬ cli@1.0.1 
│ ├── exit@0.1.2 
│ └─┬ glob@7.1.1 
│   ├── fs.realpath@1.0.0 
│   ├─┬ inflight@1.0.6 
│   │ └── wrappy@1.0.2 
│   ├── inherits@2.0.3 
│   ├─┬ minimatch@3.0.3

└─┬ rethinkdb@2.3.3 
  └── bluebird@2.11.0 

npm WARN rethink_test.js@0.0.1 No repository field.
```

So, using the app, let's interact with RethinkDB.  First, create a table named `weather`:

```bash
jims@azhat:~/src/github/acsbc_storage/app$ node ./index.js -h 13.64.114.4 -p 28015 -a create -t weather
{
  "config_changes": [
    {
      "new_val": {
        "db": "test",
        "durability": "hard",
        "id": "6adf018b-c359-4a42-87b7-3dac25757aa1",
        "indexes": [],
        "name": "weather",
        "primary_key": "id",
        "shards": [
          {
            "nonvoting_replicas": [],
            "primary_replica": "rethinkdb_111383062_m3b76_vjx",
            "replicas": [
              "rethinkdb_111383062_m3b76_vjx"
            ]
          }
        ],
        "write_acks": "majority"
      },
      "old_val": null
    }
  ],
  "tables_created": 1
}
```

Adding data to the table `weather`:

```bash
jims@azhat:~/src/github/acsbc_storage/app$ node ./index.js -h 13.64.114.4 -p 28015 -a insert -t weather -f ./data/sfo_status.json 
{
  "deleted": 0,
  "errors": 0,
  "generated_keys": [
    "318306fd-efd6-47dd-b52f-c989bf0c15fe"
  ],
  "inserted": 1,
  "replaced": 0,
  "skipped": 0,
  "unchanged": 0
}
```

And finally showing the data:

```bash
jims@azhat:~/src/github/acsbc_storage/app$ node ./index.js -h 13.64.114.4 -p 28015 -a get -t weather
[
  {
    "IATA": "SFO",
    "ICAO": "KSFO",
    "city": "San Francisco",
    "delay": "true",
    "id": "318306fd-efd6-47dd-b52f-c989bf0c15fe",
    "name": "San Francisco International",
    "state": "California",
    "status": {
      "avgDelay": "1 hour and 48 minutes",
      "closureBegin": "",
      "closureEnd": "",
      "endTime": "",
      "maxDelay": "",
      "minDelay": "",
      "reason": "WEATHER / LOW CEILINGS",
      "trend": "",
      "type": "Ground Delay"
    },
    "weather": {
      "meta": {
        "credit": "NOAA's National Weather Service",
        "updated": "5:56 PM Local",
        "url": "http://weather.gov/"
      },
      "temp": "63.0 F (17.2 C)",
      "visibility": 10,
      "weather": "Mostly Cloudy",
      "wind": "South at 13.8mph"
    }
  }
]
```

It should be noted that the output of the `create` and `insert` commands were the results returned by RethinkDB after each operation.  The content shown for `get` is the content stored in `./data/sfo_status.json` that was inserted into the database.

## Clobbering the RethinkDB pod and waiting for a new one

Now that we have data in the RethinkDB, let's go about clobbering the RethinkDB pod and see that the data persists.  In order to do this, we first need to determine the name of the RethinkDB pod and the agent that it is running on.  This will more easily show that indeed the pod has moved and the data is still there.

To determin the pod name:

```bash
jims@azhat:~/src/github/acsbc_storage/app$ kubectl --namespace=rethinkdb get pods
NAME                        READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
rethinkdb-111383062-m3b76   1/1       Running   0          1h
```

The pod name is `rethinkdb-111383062-m3b76`.  To determine the node that it is running on:

```bash
jims@azhat:~/src/github/acsbc_storage/app$ kubectl --namespace=rethinkdb describe pod rethinkdb-111383062-m3b76 | grep Node
Node:		k8s-agent-ea300e7b-2/10.240.0.5
```

So, the pod is currently running on agent `k8s-agent-ea300e7b-2`.

Clobbering the pod is as simple as:

```bash
jims@azhat:~/src/github/acsbc_storage/app$ kubectl --namespace=rethinkdb delete pod rethinkdb-111383062-m3b76
pod "rethinkdb-111383062-m3b76" deleted
```

Kubernetes will try and start a new RethinkDB pod:

```bash
jims@azhat:~/src/github/acsbc_storage/app$ kubectl --namespace=rethinkdb get pods
NAME                        READY     STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
rethinkdb-111383062-9rp0f   0/1       ContainerCreating   0          29s
```

The new pod is named `rethinkdb-111383062-9rp0f`.  

The new pod will take a couple of minutes to come up, as the Persistent Volume needs to be moved from one node to another.  The process should take a few minutes, not ten like the initial provisioning.  Again, when it is finally running:

```bash
jims@azhat:~/src/github/acsbc_storage/app$ kubectl --namespace=rethinkdb get pods
NAME                        READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
rethinkdb-111383062-9rp0f   1/1       Running   0          8m
```

The new agent that it is on can be found using the describe command again:

```bash
jims@azhat:~/src/github/acsbc_storage/app$ kubectl --namespace=rethinkdb describe pod rethinkdb-111383062-9rp0f | grep Node
Node:		k8s-agent-ea300e7b-0/10.240.0.4
```

We see that it has moved to `k8s-agent-ea300e7b-0` when it was originally on `k8s-agent-ea300e7b-2`.

# Show the persisted data

Now that the pod has moved, let's show that the data is still there:

```bash
jims@azhat:~/src/github/acsbc_storage/app$ node ./index.js -h 13.64.114.4 -p 28015 -a get -t weather
