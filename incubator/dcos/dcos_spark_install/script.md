# What are we going to do?

We'll install Apache Spark and Apache Zeppelin on Azure Container
Service with DC/OS.

## What is Apache Spark?

[Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) is a powerful general cluster
computing system for Big Data. We will be
using [DC/OS](https://dcos.io/) to deploy a Spark cluster. We will
also install [Zeppelin](https://zeppelin.apache.org/), a web-based
notebook for data analytics, making it easier to interact with Spark.

## What is Apache Zeppelin?

[Apache Zepellin](http://zeppelin.apache.org/) web-based notebook that
enables interactive data analytics. It has excellent integration with
Apache Spark.

## What is Azure Container Service?

Azure Container Service optimizes the configuration of popular
open-source tools and technologies specifically for Azure. You get an
open solution that offers portability for both your containers and
your application configuration. You select the size, number of hosts,
and choice of orchestrator tools-Container Service handles everything
else.

# Next Steps

  1. [Create ACS DC/OS cluster](preparation/script.md)
  2. [Install Apache Spark and Apache Zeppelin](install/script.md)
  3. [Delete the ACS DC/OS cluster](cleanup/script.md)
