# DC/OS with Kafka, Cassandra and more

See See https://github.com/RobBagby/dcos-kafka-cassandra

## Prerequisites

For this demo / tutorial you will need to have a DC/OS cluster up and
running, if you don't yet have one then work
through [creating a DC/OS cluster on ACS](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/acs-demos/master/dcos/create_cluster/README.md). 

We also need to ensure that we are [connected to the cluster](../manage_cluster).

## Examining the Cluster

```
