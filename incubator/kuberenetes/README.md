Learn how to create Kubernetes clusters on Azure Container Service.

Each of these demos is written as a human readable script, but using
the SimDem tool it is also possible to use these scripts to create
interactive demo's. To understand how this works run the command
`docker run -it rgardler/simdem`. To run each individual demo see the
command listed in the appropriate demo section below.

Each tutorial can be run in a "teach" mode or a "simulate/demo"
mode. In teach mode descriptive text will be displayed, hit a key to
proceed every time the tutorial pauses. In simulate/demo mode the
descriptive text is not displayed and each command is "typed" for you
so that you can concentrate on describing what it happening. Hit
return once the command has been typed and it will be executed for
you.

To run in tutorial mode run `./teach.sh NAME` where NAME is the name
of the tutorial.

To run in simulation/demo mode run `./demo.sh NAME` where NAME is the
name.

The first thing people need to do is create a cluster. This demo
