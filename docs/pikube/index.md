Card games have to be run somewhere, why not on a Raspberry Pi
Kubernetes Cluster?

The Raspeberry Pi is a very cheap single board computer. Kubernetes is
a container orchestrator. Why do we need it to run the games? Well, we
don't, but it's a hardware and infrastrcuture project that some people
might be interested in - who doesn't want to build their own data
center? 

By using Docker containers for the management of
the application we make it easier for everyone to get
involved. Finally, if we make it work on the Raspberry Pi we can make
it work in the cloud too, if we wnat to.

Over time this will become a tutorial, for now it's a bunch of links
to useful resources relating to building a Raspberry Pi cluster
managed by Kubernetes.
