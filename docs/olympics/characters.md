# Characters

Characters have the following meta-data:

  * Name - the name they are known by
  * Description - a brief description
  * Special ability - an ability that they can use in competitions to
    give themselves an advantage
  * Traits - The characteristics that are used in competitions to
    determine the outcome (see below)
		
## Traits
		
Traits are point values that indicate how a character will perform in
competitions. For example, Strength will be the primary trait used in
weight lifting. Each character has the following traits:
		
  * Strength
  * Dexterity
  * Intelligence
  * Charisma
  * Reactions
  * Stamina
					
Characters have a number of points that can be distributed across
these traits. They receive 10 point per trait currently in use in the
game. Early versions of the game have 6 traits and thus each character
has 60 points to distribute. These can be used in any way as long as
each trait has at least one point assigned to it.
					
## Example characters
					
### Foo
					
Foo is a lovable character with no significant distinguishing
features. Everyone knows Foo, but nobody remembers him. He has a
sister, Bar, who is equally as forgettable, but likable.

Foo's special ability is that he can see a fraction of a second into
the future, this means that he gets a '+2' on the reactions trait.

## Bar
					
Bar is a lovable character with no significant distinguishing
features. Everyone knows Bar, but nobody remembers her. She has a
brother, Foo, who is equally as forgettable, but likable.

Bar's special abliity is that she can dig deep into her energy
reserves and keep going longer than most other characters. Bar gets a
'+2' on Stamina.
